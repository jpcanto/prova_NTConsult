# NTConsult test

## DEV: Jo√£o Pedro Lopes Canto 

## User history:

I, as a user, wish to be able to consume information about the films of the star wars saga, in a simple and interactive way

## How will it be done? (technical requirements)

- The application will consume, through the API "https://swapi.dev/api/" all the information displayed to the user, using the endpoints: (Planets, People and Films).
- The application must provide an excellent user experience, being interactive, easy to understand and always informing the user of an action or failure.
- The application must be scalable, preferably using the flux architecture, state control with redux, good code writing practices and provide a document for easy handling in the development environment (README).

## to run the application you need:

### Install all project dependencies using:

`yarn` or `npm install`

### so, with all the project dependencies installed, let's run the application using:

 `yarn start` or `npm start`

 OBS: if the project does not open automatically in your browser, access it manually by typing: http://localhost:3000
